1. Perform the following queries on "Locations" table: 

a. select all locations that have the capacity between 200 and 1000 persons
SELECT * FROM Locations WHERE Capacity BETWEEN 200 AND 1000

b. select all locations that have "a" in their name
SELECT * FROM Locations WHERE Locationname LIKE '%a%'

c. Select all locations that are not in Cluj-Napoca
SELECT * FROM Locations WHERE City NOT LIKE 'Cluj-Napoca'

d. Select all locations that have the cost 0,500,600, are in Brasov and Cluj-Napoca, and can sustain a capacity greater that 1000 persons
SELECT * FROM Locations WHERE Cost IN (0,500,600) AND City IN ('Cluj-Napoca','Brasov') AND Capacity>1000

2. Perform the following queries on "Events" table: 
a. return the results for min, max, average based on "EventCost" column
SELECT MIN(Eventcost),MAX(Eventcost),AVG(Eventcost) FROM Events

b. count how many events are associated to location 1 and 2
SELECT COUNT(LocationID) from Events WHERE LocationID IN (1,2)

c. compute the average cost obtained from location 1
SELECT AVG(Eventcost) FROM Events WHERE LocationID=1

d. order the events based on their defined date
SELECT * FROM Events ORDER BY Eventdate 

e. compute the total cost associated with each location (hint grouped by)
SELECT SUM(Eventcost),LocationID FROM Events GROUP BY LocationID



3. Perform the following queries using both tables
a. Order location name, descending, after their associated event cost
SELECT Events.Eventcost,Locations.Locationname FROM Events JOIN Locations ON Events.LocationID=Locations.LocationID ORDER BY Eventcost DESC

b. Select location name, location cost and event cost for a specific event
SELECT Locations.Locationname,Locations.Cost,Events.Eventname,Events.Eventcost FROM Locations,Events WHERE Locations.LocationID=Events.LocationID 
sau
SELECT l.Locationname,l.Cost,e.Eventname,e.Eventcost FROM Locations l,Events e WHERE l.LocationID=e.LocationID

c. Return the first 3 events (with eventName, locationname), that have the greatest event cost, in alphabetical order (after their names)
SELECT Locations.Locationname,Events.Eventname,Events.Eventcost FROM Locations,Events WHERE Locations.LocationID=Events.LocationID ORDER BY Eventcost DESC, Eventname ASC FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY
